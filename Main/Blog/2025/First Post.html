        <h1>Hi!</h1>

        <p>
          I've been working on and off on this website for about three months,
          but I'm happy it's close to fully set up! My name is Brian Tan and I'm
          currently a third year electrical engineering major at UCLA. This is
          my first year here, being a transfer from a community college student
          at De Anza in Cupertino, California. Here is a picture of me when I
          was passing by Santa Barbara on the way to Los Angeles:
        </p>

        <p>
          Although I'm still a student, it's nice to be in a place like Los
          Angeles where there's a lot of great food spots and photogenic places.
          Since coming here, I've been to only Beverly Hills and Santa Monica as
          well as a few specific places such as the Griffith Observatory, but
          I've still yet to explore a lot of the main tourist locations, such as
          downtown LA, Long Beach, the Orange County area, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although I'm eager to visit all these places, a part of me is telling
          me to wait until I can get a better phone or camera, but preferably
          camera, since I'm interested in trying photography. There was a person
          on Facebook Marketplace selling a Sony Cybershot DSC H5 including two
          lenses for a great deal of $25, but I couldn't get it because of how
          fast the seller wanted to get rid of it. Otherwise, I've been taking
          photos with my iPhone 11, which has been incredibly mid at taking
          pictures. Regardless, when walking around in Santa Monica, I took one
          of my favorite photos at the Venice Canals using the iPhone.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          Another thing that I'm excited to post about is food! I really enjoy
          cooking and baking because I think that making food is really
          cathartic, and eating it even more so. This is a club sandwich that I
          ordered at a quaint but otherwise unassuming spot, if it weren't for
          the massive line of locals. This was at Bayside Cafe in Morro Bay,
          which had a nice view of the pier and classic diner-type atmosphere
          inside. The sandwich must have been one of the best sandwiches I've
          had - the bread was crisp but not dry, vegetables and meat were in the
          exact best ratio, and the light amount of mustard made everything perfect.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          One of my favorite things is to work on projects from the ground up, mainly because I'm stubborn. That
          includes a lot of my projects, one of which was my stenography
          keyboard when I was learning how to basic PCB design in KiCad. My
          friend had just introduced me to his own hobby of making keyboards, to
          which I had very little opinion of but was decently interested only
          because it seemed like a cool project to design a keyboard. I was also
          very lucky to choose this as an introductory project because QMK has a
          lot of tutorials on how to design and map your own keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ended up using an ATMega32 microcontroller, which had a lot more
          documentation and was easier to solder than some of the QFN packages,
          which need a heat gun. From there, it was just assemble it, program
          it, and plug it in and the keyboard was done!
        </p>
        <img
          src="Images/First Post/steno.JPG"
          class="img"
          alt="Steno Keyboard"
        />

        <p>
          However, after doing a fair bit of research on the type of switches,
          modifications for the keyboard, and designing the keycaps, I really
          got into building keyboards. Currently, I'm working on two other
          keyboards which I'm hoping will turn out well, both powered by the
          RP2040 using QMK, with one board having Aurora Fog switches and some
          generic MOA keycaps from Amazon, and the other having BSUN Flower
          Shadow switches along with KAM Superuser keycaps. Although I'm
          spending a lot of money between switches and keycaps, especially just
          for the keycaps to be dye-sub instead of double shot, I think I'll
          still be happy with the outcome.
        </p>

          This website is also a project! However, I'm not very good at coding so I only have a basic understanding of using CSS styling and HTML. The rest I've had to refer to GPT or Stack Exchange to find out how to do Javascript and some other bits. My favorite thing about this website is that I have it hosted on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, details of which will be in a separate post.
