      This is a 60% layout keyboard that was designed using a two layer board in
      KiCad, using an RP2040 for the microcontroller since its' supported by
      QMK. The case was 3D printed in two parts without any adhesive, and the
      components, including keycaps, were all hand soldered. The keycaps I've
      used are some generic MOA keycaps found from Amazon, and the switches were
      hand lubed with somme offbrand 205g grease. This is the final build and
      sound I've gotten with the Aurora Fog switches from Wuque Studios, along
      with a thin layer of polyurethane foam from McMaster. <br /><br />

      This keyboard started with designing the PCB, utilizing Raspberry Pi's
      hardware design guidelines for the RP2040, with the only deviation from
      following the guide being the flash, which I chose to be the IS25LP080
      over QMK's default W25Q080, which is out of stock on LCSC.On the RP2040
      hardware design guidelines flash section, it does use a W25Q128JVS as an
      example. In hindsight, I think I could have used this instead, since it's
      cheaper and should work similarly since its' in the same family of
      products. <br /><br />

      There are a couple mistakes in the PCB. The boards on the Github page are
      the corrected ones, though I don't have any intention of ordering the new
      ones and also testing if they work. For the time being though, I've been
      using my old boards to hard wire some odd bits, such as connecting the
      data lines of the USB past the TVS diodes, which makes me feel very on
      edge plugging it in every time. I also have some odd parts that I somehow
      missed giving power, and messed up the flash pins on one side which I
      ordered a replacement PCB that fixed the pin layout. <br /><br />

      Here's the board, along with the 3D printed case design and polyurethane:

      <br /><br />

      I decided to mount this board with M3 screws. The file is now corrected to
      give full clearance, but I used M3 holes for self tapping, so they were
      something around 2.8mm diameter instead of the 3.4mm needed for clearance.
      In order to fix the board, I had to drill holes. <br /><br />

      Part of the custom design was so that I could screw down the board more to
      prevent sag. I don't particularly like plate mounts, but having screws and
      a plate mount which in which it's literally screwed into the bottom
      instead of a small gap in most keyboards I think gives this keyboard a
      little more rigidity while still retaining some of the satisfaction of
      pressing down and having the board give a little from the polyurethane. In
      order to make this plate, I took a piece of plywood and laser cut it
      exactly how I needed it for a keyboard with plate mount stabilizers...
      before realizing I bought PCB mount stabilizers. So I dremeled out the
      parts that couldn't fit with the PCB mount stabilizers, hence the ugly
      plate. Additionally, I also had to make small divots for space in the
      front where the stabilizers jutted out from the PCB, since pressure on
      these parts of the stabilizers prevented the spacebar from pressing down
      properly. In order to fit the screws, the case I designed has little
      divots for the screws to mate with an M3 hex nut for a very necessary
      fancy factor. <br /><br />

      Last but not least was assembling all of this together! I learned how to
      and took apart each of the Aurora Fog switches and lubed the bottom
      housing along with the stem rim and hole, the sides of the stem, and
      applied an even coating of lube across the springs the GPL 205g. Unlubed
      they had a great balance between thocky and light, but after lubing the
      switches, they sounded and felt incredibly smooth and creamy, so I believe
      lubing the switches were well worth the hours of work. <br /><br />

      Last but not least, here's a typing test video. For the keycaps, I found
      some MOA style keycaps simply because they were taller and would give me a
      deeper sound, in addition to them being astronaut keycaps. One small note,
      I couldn't find a 2.25u key to fit the bottom right switch, so I just
      grabbed a 1.25u and put it on instead. Overall, I think the sound is more
      on the muted side, but I'm really happy with the quality of the sound and
      feel of the switches. <br /><br />
