      This is a 65% keyboard that I meant to be a very low budget keyboard. The
      biggest reason why I called the other keyboard the "Budget Keyboard", and
      not this one was because I believed that this one would not qualify to be
      a daily driver. I was was sort of correct with this one, especially since
      I felt like the acoustics and keycaps were very lacking. However, the
      typing itself did feel pretty good in the end. <br />
      <br />

      Since this was a project for the 3D printing club, the first part
      manufactured was the case. This was printed at the makerspace at UCLA,
      with somewhat dubious print quality. I believe that it came out a little
      less polished than I expected because of the high nozzle diameter, I think
      somewhere around 0.4mm. For the case design, I cut out a hole in the
      middle to put a copper weight, only to realize how unfeasible that would
      be, and ended up not doing anything with it. I think it was because of
      this hole that the acoustics were off, especially if sound was traveling
      through the keyboard into the desk rather than reverberating back towards
      the top. Here is the case: <br /><br />

      <img src="Images/Bakeneko65/case.JPG" class="img" alt="" /> <br />
      <br />

      In this image above you will notice some additional parts, paint, and a
      mat of polyurethane 0.25" foam. You can see the individual layers of the
      print from the inside of the case, compared to the outside, which were
      sanded for hours. I started from a higher grit just to get all of the
      jagged edges smooth, before leveling everything out with high grit
      sandpaper. Afterwards, we (the club) had primer and spray paint - I left
      the inside semi-coated to show off the steps taken after everything was
      done, layer by layer. The two additional black parts are for the USB, and
      a spacer for an empty space on the keyboard. Do also look at the joints
      for having a split case - they're not fantastic because of the print
      quality, and can actually rattle quite a bit after putting the two split
      parts together. <br />
      <br />

      This is a soldered board that I used along with the daughterboard
      necessary to be able to program and use the keyboard. I didn't buy the
      board myself, so I didn't have the daughterboard and had to order one from
      cannonkeys, which is the C5 JST variant. In order to program the keyboard,
      I ended up doing some funky workarounds in order to now have to make a new
      keyboard in QMK, and used QMK toolbox + QMK configurator instead. Since
      the Bakeneko uses an ATMEGA32U4, I was able to use QMK configurator to
      acquire my

        style="color: #ff6600"
        >.hex file</a
      >
      and program to the keyboard by launching it into bootloader by plugging it
      in and pressince ESC at the same time, installing drivers through QMK
      toolbox, and flashing it. <br />
      <br />

      <br />

      This is the board almost after everything was soldered and put in,
      including Gateron oil kings, Glorious stabilizers, and a cheap Chinese
      knockoff set of gradient blue keycaps. The gaterons were not modified at
      all, but the stabilizers definitely were. In fact, these stabilizers had
      phenomenally low quality such that I had to put put in a lot of band-aid
      mods and lube in order to make them at least somewhat bearable. Because of
      the spacing between the stabilizer bar and joint that it snaps into was
      far too large, every time I hit the stabilizer it would rattle and feel
      almost as if I was hitting a tactile switch rather than a linear. In order
      to fix this, I put band-aids (yes, that's how much clearance it was
      missing) in the little joint to fill it in. I then also lubed the sides
      and band-aids, as well put in band-aids on the bottom of the stabilizers to
      make them less harsh. Please never get these stabilizers. Here is an image
      of them so you know to forever avoid them: <br /><br />

      <br />
      <br />

      Before assembling all of it together, I lined each of the parts up for fit
      just in case. Turns out, the print for the case came out so poorly that
      one side was actually higher than the other. My guess is that the printer
      wasn't leveled before printing, since it was significant enough to warrant
      9 layers of tape on the right side in order prevent bending when typing on
      that side of the keyboard. Here is the little patch I made last minute:
      <br /><br />

      Lastly, here is the typing test. The video below is a test with no foam,
      and the following one is with foam. Note that this build is relatively low
      quality, partially due to the print, design, keycaps ($5), and combination
      with oil kings (probably fine, but also probably an underlying reason why
      I got them for free). <br /><br />

      And here is the one with foam: <br />

      </div>
      <br /><br />

      Overall, I think I prefer the one with foam despite the higher pitched
      typing, simply because it creates more of a cushion when typing as well as
      dampens the sound to a bearable volume compared to no foam.
